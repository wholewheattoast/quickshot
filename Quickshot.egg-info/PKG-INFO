# quickshot
Make a quick visualdiff between two pages or png files.


## Requirements
Currently Quickshot only uses the Geckodriver webdriver.
Downloading and installing [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) may be sufficient to get you set up.

Ensure Firefox is in your path after installing.

You may also need to install Geckodriver separately.
- On a Mac run, `brew install geckodriver`
- For Windows or Unix binaries see the release section of the [Geckodriver project page](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver).

You should also have ImageMagick installed.
Test if you already have ImageMagick installed by running, `convert -version` in your terminal.

### Installing ImageMagick
- On a Mac run, `brew install imagemagick`
- [Windows binaries](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows)
- [Unix Binaries](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#unix)


## Installation
### Via Pip
- Run `pip install quickshot`

### From source
- Set up a virtuanenv in some fashion, `vex --python /usr/local/bin/python3 -m quickshot`
- Install dependencies `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


## ini files
You can add credentials to sign in to a web form in a file called 'quickshot.ini'.

Since the .ini is included in the `.gitignore` file, (To help prevent you from committing your credentials to the cloud), you'll first need to create it.

Each block can contain an `login` and `password` items.

Quickshot will attempt to use `webdriver.find_element_by_name()` to locate elements on the page that correspond to these values.

An example configuration block might look like;
```
[example]
login = doe@example.com
password = foobar
```


## Usage
Quickshot takes two required arguments being the urls of the two pages you want to compare.
```python quickshot.py "http://www.google.com" "http://www.google.fr"```

There are also some optional arguments;
- `-w, --wait`, length in seconds to wait after loading a page before taking a screenshot.
- `-i, --ini`, named section to load from `quickshot.ini` configuration file.
- `-f, --files`, flag allowing you to pass in names of `.png` files stored in `/screenshots` instead of urls.
